# The Latch 5 streaming engine

Latch 4 shared a desktop through Sunshine (C++) and viewed it through
moonlight-common-c (C), OpenH264 (C++) and libopus (C). Latch 5 does both
in Rust, inside the one `latch-host` executable that already runs the
control service and the window.

## Boundary

Everything Latch ships is Rust source compiled by `rustc`. Allowed below
that line, because they are the platform rather than a library we chose:

* operating-system and driver APIs called from Rust: ScreenCaptureKit,
  VideoToolbox, CoreGraphics, CoreAudio (macOS); DXGI, Direct3D 11, Media
  Foundation, WASAPI, SendInput (Windows); the X11 protocol, spoken by the
  pure-Rust `x11rb`, and the PulseAudio/PipeWire server (Linux); Metal,
  Vulkan or DX12 through `wgpu`;
* the GPU vendors' encoders and decoders those APIs reach (NVENC, AMF,
  Quick Sync, Apple's media engine);
* the Windows virtual display driver, which is a driver;
* Rust crates from crates.io that contain no C, C++ or assembler files.

No crate in the build may compile C, C++ or assembler with `cc`, `cmake`
or `nasm`. `scripts/audit-native.sh` checks the resolved build graph and
CI runs it.

| Crate | What | Platform code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latch-proto` | wire format, Reed–Solomon FEC, packetizer and reassembler, input reliability, control framing, an impairment simulator for tests | none |
| `latch-codec` | H.264 Constrained Baseline encoder and decoder, BGRA→YUV conversion, the `lpcm-rice` audio codec | none |
| `latch-engine` | the host side: capture, encode, audio capture, input injection, display sizing, and the session server | `mac/`, `windows/`, `linux/` |
| `latch-stream` | the viewer side: session, decoders (VideoToolbox, Media Foundation, `latch-codec`), audio playback | `video/` |

### Video paths

| Host | Capture | Encode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | ScreenCaptureKit, NV12 IOSurface at the stream size, cursor included | VideoToolbox (HEVC, H.264 High, or Constrained Baseline), real time, no frame reordering |
| Windows | DXGI Desktop Duplication, BGRA texture; cursor drawn in; Direct3D 11 video processor to NV12 at the stream size | Media Foundation H.264 encoder (the GPU's MFT, else Microsoft's); `latch-codec` if neither works |
| Linux (X11) | MIT-SHM `GetImage` through `x11rb`, cursor from XFixes | `latch-codec` software encoder, threads by slice |

| Viewer | Decode |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | VideoToolbox (HEVC or H.264) |
| Windows | Media Foundation H.264 decoder (DXVA when present), else `latch-codec` |
| Linux | `latch-codec` |

The viewer lists what it decodes; the host picks the first it can encode.
`latch-codec` decodes Constrained Baseline only, so a host asked for
`h264-baseline` configures its hardware encoder for that profile.

The software encoder is built for desktops, not films: a macroblock whose
source pixels did not change since the last frame costs a skip and no
search; changed macroblocks get a small motion search seeded by their
neighbours and a scroll detector, and intra prediction. Rate control is a
per-frame QP from a one-frame VBV, so a frame never takes much longer than
its interval on the wire.

### Audio

48 kHz stereo 16-bit, 10 ms frames, coded losslessly with `lpcm-rice`
(fixed linear prediction and Rice codes, like FLAC's fixed predictors).
Silence costs a few bytes a frame and a desktop's sound about 0.5–1 Mbps;
coding it costs microseconds. The decoded samples are exactly the
captured ones, which lets tests check audio bit for bit. Opus is gone.

## Decisions

* **No pairing.** The control service's authorization (same Tailscale
  account, or the tailnet of a tagged host) already guards `/v1/update`,
  which replaces the executable. A stream needs no stronger check. The
  session token travels inside WireGuard.
* **UDP + FEC + keyframe on loss**, as Moonlight did, without RTSP, ENet or
  a second encryption layer. Input is reliable by redundancy, not timers.
* **Newest frame wins** on the viewer (`FrameSlot`), every frame is decoded
  (P-frames depend on each other), and a lost frame stops decoding until a
  keyframe.
* **One viewer at a time.** A new authorized viewer takes the host over;
  the old one gets `End` code 1.
* **Display sizing** stays where it was: a Linux desktop that follows its
  viewer is resized by the engine (`xrandr` semantics through RandR) or by
  the owner's prep command; Windows sets the virtual display's mode; macOS
  captures the main display and lets ScreenCaptureKit scale it.

## Compatibility

Latch 5 viewers speak only protocol 1; Latch 5 hosts speak only protocol 1.
A Latch 5 viewer that finds a Latch 4 host (no `streamer.protocol` in
`/v1/status`) sends it the update it already knows how to send
(`/v1/update`, as a Mac does for Windows hosts today) or says which
machine to update. A Latch 4 viewer finds no GameStream port on a Latch 5
host and offers its own update. Pairing data, Sunshine's configuration and
the engine folders of Latch 4 are removed by Latch 5's setup.

## Evidence

What shows the engine is right, other than its authors:

* the ITU-T H.264.1 conformance bitstreams: the decoder's output must equal
  each stream's reference YUV byte for byte;
* VideoToolbox and FFmpeg as independent decoders of the encoder's
  output, which must equal the encoder's own reconstruction byte for byte;
* known-pixel test patterns through the whole pipeline, compared after
  decode;
* bit-exact audio through the whole pipeline;
* the impairment simulator (loss, bursts, reordering, duplication, delay)
  for the transport, and measured loss on the real campus Wi-Fi path;
* input-to-photon timing measured on the viewer's own clock: the viewer
  presses a key, a pattern on the host changes colour, the viewer times
  until it decodes the change;
* CPU, memory and energy of host and viewer, measured against Latch 4 at
  the same size, frame rate and bitrate;
* `scripts/audit-native.sh`: no C, C++ or assembler in the build graph.
